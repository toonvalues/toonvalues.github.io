<h2>What is toonvalues?</h2>
    <p>toonvalues, based off of <a href="https://8values.github.io/">8values</a> is, in essence, a quiz that attempts to assign percentages for eight different values that are encountered in Toontown: Corporate Clash. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. This quiz is not meant to be taken seriously!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2><a id="anchor">What are the eight values?</a></h2>
    <p>There are four independent axes - Strategy, Role, Style, and Evolution - and each has two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</p>

        <div class="spacer">
            <div class="explanation_blurb_left">
                <p class="value"><b style="color:#8893E0;">SIMPLE</b></p>
                <p class="blurb-text">
                    Those with higher Simple scores believe that complicated strategies require too much thought to be effective. They tend to stray away from Zap gags and diverse gag usage in a turn. Additionally, they use sound whenever possible.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="explanation_axis">
                <p class="axis_name">STRATEGY</p>

            <div class="explanation_blurb_right">
                <p class="value"><b style="color:#FFF696;">COMPLEX</b></p>
                <p class="blurb-text">
                    Those with higher Complex scores believe that more complicated strategies like Syphon, and Double Zap, are both more satisfying and efficient. They tend to avoid wasteful sound use and are usually highly knowledgable on Zaps mechanics.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="spacer">
            <div class="explanation_blurb_left">
                <p class="value"><b style="color:#FFBCE7;">PASSIVE</b></p>
                <p class="blurb-text">
                    Those with higher Passive scores often talk very little in battle. They will usually follow the leader, and will use strategies that may be inaccurate.
                </p>

            <div class="explanation_axis">

                <p class="blurb-text">
                    Those with higher Leader scores are often the ones suggesting strategies in battle. They often will confidently put forward ideas if the team hasn't committed to another one.

                <p class="value"><b style="color:#DC6665;">QUANITY</b></p>
                <p class="blurb-text">
                    Those with higher Quanity scores have a preference for more gags rather than many prestiges. They often enjoy having many choices, being able to mostly synergize with any group, however having very little specialty, otherwise.

                <p class="value"><b style="color:#E768C5;">QUALITY</b></p>
                <p class="blurb-text">
                    Those with higher Quality scores prefer to have as many prestiges as possible. They prefer to maxamize their synergy with specific strategies and may be relunctant to group with people their strategy does not work with.

                <p class="blurb-text">
                    Those with higher Tradition scores believe in traditional values. They prefer old features and may dislike new changes being added to the game. They also tend to exhibit more elitist behavior than others.

                <p class="value"><b style="color:#9EEBEF;">PROGRESS</b></p>
                <p class="blurb-text">
                    Those with higher Progress scores believe in change and rationality. They believe more updates and exposure will grow the game to a larger audience. They also may feel that certain mechanics in the game are outdated and need change.

<h2 style="margin-top: 17pt;">What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
    <p>In addition to matching you to the eight values, the quiz also attempts to match you to a political ideology. This is a work in progress and is much less accurate than the values and axes, so don't take it too seriously. If you disagree with your assigned ideology, send us an email at eightvalues@gmail.com with your scores, matched ideology, and preferred ideology, and we'll look into adjusting the system. Thanks!</p>
